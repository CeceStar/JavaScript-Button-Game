# The Button Game 

### (Brief 2 *Fundamentals - Interactive webpage*)

A game about "not clicking a button". My first try on Javascript!

The brief was to create a javascript game, and I was so completly new to Javascript that I could not imagine how I was supposed to create a game. I told people in the class that ".. All I can do is create a clickable button", and the idea was born!

I was superproud over this project, It was a moment for me proving to myselft that I can actually do this. It might be new and hard, but Im learning and making progress. A big moment :)
